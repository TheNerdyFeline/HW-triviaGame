I used jquery, timeOut, and a timer to create a timed trvia game. I used a random number generator to choose a random question, but found it caused too many repeats per game. Based on the birthday theory, if 23 random people were put in a room there would be over 50% chance 2 of them would have the same birthday.  I decided I would shuffle the questions array and slice the first 10 instead to eliminate repeats in a single game. I would like to add more questions later and increase the number of questions in each game.
